[Link to Project Site (currently in Alpha)](https://cse110-sp23-group28.github.io/cse110-sp23-group28/source/)

## Project Description:
The Bae-O-Meter™ is a state of the art fortune telling website that can predict the strength of a relationship between any two entities. After entering some basic information about each party, the Bae-O-Meter™ will factor each piece of data into its algorithm, and precisely and mathematically determine exactly how long their hypothetical relationship would last, and how it will end.

## How to use the Bae-O-Meter:
1. Click the "start" button on the home page
2. Enter the names and birthdays of you and your potential bae, and press the "test" button to move on
3. Draw something on the envelope using your mouse (or finger if you are on mobile), and press the "next" button
4. Finally, choose one of the three love letters on screen, and press the "next" button
5. The results should be displayed on the screen. If you would like to explore another potential relationship, press the "test again" button to start over.
