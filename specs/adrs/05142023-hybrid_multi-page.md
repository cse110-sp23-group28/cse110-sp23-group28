## ADR: Hybrid Multi-Page and Single Page with Animations

### Context
We are developing a website called "Predicting Relationship Duration". The website aims to provide users with an interactive tool to predict how long their current romantic relationship will last. The website will use a combination of user-input data and statistical analysis to generate a prediction.

### Decision
After considering the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches, we have decided to implement a hybrid design that combines multi-page and single-page design with animations. This decision was based on the following reasons:

- **Usability:** Multi-page design is intuitive and easy to use for users who are accustomed to traditional websites, while single-page design with animations enhances user experience and engagement.
- **User Experience:**  By using animations, we can provide users with a more engaging and interactive experience. Animations can help to guide users through the prediction process and keep them engaged with the site.
  
- **Flexibility:** A hybrid design allows us to choose the best approach for each page or section of the application based on its requirements and goals.
-  **Ease of Navigation:** By using a multi-page design, users can easily navigate through different sections of the website without getting overwhelmed by too much information on a single page.

### Consequences
The hybrid multi-page and single page design with animations will require additional development time and resources. Additionally, the use of animations may cause the website to load slower for some users. However, we believe that the benefits of this design approach outweigh these potential drawbacks.
### Conclusion 
Based on the ADR, we have decided to implement a hybrid multi-page and single page design with animations for the "Predicting Relationship Duration" website. The decision was made after considering the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches, and we believe that the hybrid design will provide the best user experience and flexibility. While the implementation of this design approach will require additional development time and resources, we believe that the benefits of this approach outweigh the potential drawbacks.
