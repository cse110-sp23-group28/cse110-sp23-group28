# ADR: Replacing JSLint with ESLint for CI/CD

## Context and Problem Statement
  The goal is to implement a linter in our CI/CD pipeline in order to automatically check for formatting, especially with JSDocs conventions. Our in initial group decision was to utilize JSLint to achieve this purpose, but by brief research of the designated assignee (Brandon Reponte) for implementing this functionality it was discovered that JSLint does not support JSDocs conventions well. On the contrary, it was also discovered the ESLint, another popular JavaScript linter, had pluggins and libraries readily accessible in order to support JSDocs conventions.

## Decision
  Ultimately, ESLint will be preferred over JSLint as ESLint was found to be more customizable in linting, which best fits our team's personal preferences of neatly written and readable code.

### Considered Options
  JSLint was understood to be a viable option, but for the most part it fails in customizability against ESLint. Another goal of our project is exploration of tools, so configurability is highly preferred.

### Consequences
  By this decision, we forgo our exploration of JSLint, another popular linting service that could do well in future projects. Based on our current needs, ESLint is the better option, but JSLint may prove to be a superior option in realistic project environments with more formal restrictions.
