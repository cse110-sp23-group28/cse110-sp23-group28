# App Pitch - The Bae-O-Meter

## Summary

​Our pitch is a web app that predicts the outcome of a relationship based on their birthdays, names, and responses to various interactive tasks. These tasks include choosing from a random set of cards, "palm reading" or "fingerprint reading" by keysmashing the physical keyboard/touchscreen keyboard, and drawing on a canvas. By analyzing the input to these tasks and the couple's astrological compatibility using their Zodiac signs, our app will provide users with a metric of how long their relationship will last, along with a pre-generated story about their relationship's future. 
​
## Narrowing Down the Problem

Couples in relationships oftentimes have a vague idea of how long their relationship might last. Additionally, people who consider starting a new relationship might want an idea of how compatible they are as a couple and how well a potential relationship with them could last before investing in that person. This app aims to solve that problem and determine how long a couple will last.

## User Personas

### Persona 1​: Avery
​
Avery (female, 21) is a 3rd year CSE student at UCSD interested in astrology and intrigued by its influences on human behavior. 

Motivation: She has a crush on Ethan, her homework partner for her CSE 3 class. She and Ethan have been getting along quite well while doing homework together and she is considering a relationship with him. She has never been in a relationship before because she spent years doing LeetCode instead of interacting with others, so she wants to know how long she and Ethan might last before investing time into a relationship with him. She is intrigued about how astrologically compatible she and Ethan are. She can use The Bae-O-Meter to get an idea of how long she and Ethan will last to help her decide whether to ask him out.

### Persona 2: Bob

Bob (male, 24) and Emma (male, 25) are high school sweethearts and have been together ever since. Bob thinks that Emma is the love of his life and wants to propose to her soon. 

Motivation: Bob is intrigued by what the future has in store for them, and wants to know what a fortune teller might tell him about his relationship, so he would know if proposing is the right choice. Bob thinks that Emma is the person he wants to be with, but he still cannot decide if she is the one. Online sources do not have any information specific to his situation, and so he wants a fortune teller to show him his relationship’s future.
​
### Persona 3:

Tommy (male, 20) and Michelle (female, 19) just got together and they are so in love with each other. Tommy thinks Michelle is his final lover, and Michelle thinks Tommy can be her husband in the future.

Motivation: Tommy and Michelle think they are very compatible and will last forever as a couple, but they want to know for sure.

Frustrations: Online sources have said to be careful about such feelings of “forever” and the only way to know for sure is to ask a fortune telling app like Bae-O-Meter.
