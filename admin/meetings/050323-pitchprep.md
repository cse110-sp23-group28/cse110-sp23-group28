### TA Meeting Notes
  - do a retrospective on the 8ball project
  - project seems pretty good
  - everyone should be working on the code
  - define timelines and how much work each task will take
  - test code thoroughly
  - defensive testing, assume things go wrong?
  - pair programming if there aren't enough features to develop
    - one experienced person with one inexperienced person
  - each person should do their individual documentation
  - pitch is ideally in markdown
  - add links to channel description?

### 8Ball retrospective:
  - The development happened by people pushing code on their own without much notice or planning
  - Instead of designing the app as we code it, we should design it beforehand
- Everyone didn’t get a chance to code/be involved

### The Pitch
- Risks
- Rabbit Holes
- Visual Representation - System Diagram
- Visual Representation - Wireframe
- Statement of Purpose
- User Personas


### Further Project Brainstorming
  - Project: How long will your relationship last
  - Output: some time frame such as “1-5 years”, “5-10 years”, “forever”
  - Inputs: your birthday, partner’s birthday
  - Backend stuff: take user input, distill it to a single score, use the score to determine the predicted timing of relationship
  - Other Inputs: pick a card (left, middle, right), use that choice to affect the output
  - Extra features: use ChatGPT API to tell a story about how the user will
