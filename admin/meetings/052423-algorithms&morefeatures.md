## New Business

### TA Meeting Notes
- retrospective / review meetings is based on this week’s sprint
- our choice to remove 8ball
- recommended to add more features this week bc Satvik is going to be busy next two weeks


### Reflecting on Checkpoint #1
- some branch names are too long: don't say stuff like "CI/CD" if ur only implementing the linter, better name would be just "linter"
- many PRs and not enough reviewers
- we need to decide on what to include in the .gitignore
- we should make a cleaner file structure (remove the 8ball project?)
	- add 8ball code to the other repository that was just unarchived
- setting up a code quality tool (codacy?)
- test GitHub actions w/o spamming commits
- no more using Chat GPT w/o proper testing
- talk more about deploying site on other platforms

### Assignments to Complete
- Sprint Review Meeting
- Sprint Retrospective
- Team Status Video

### Upcoming Sprint
- Add version numbers: (Semantic Versioning)[https://semver.org]
- Add Changelog, release notes, and roadmap

### Starting Implementation Tasks (to be added via GitHub issues)
- Improve the algorithm
            - Add zodiac compatibility measures (12x12 matrix or hashmap) to replace ASCII
	- Map the ranges of scores to time periods
- Add the cards
- Add the canvas
- Implement next and back buttons for each section (name/birthday, cards, canvas (if it’s there), result)
