## Mad, Sad, Glad

### MAD:
- Trying to figure out how to write an end-to-end test was frustrating
- find a lot of ways to fix the html div position.
- hard to tell whether we’re on the right track sometimes
- CIDI confusion, github action, jest and github hook setup

### SAD:
- Couldn’t do more?
- The web seems little bit sample.
- Not everyone can make to meeting times
- Could have enforced a bit more strict time deadline for each part
- More discussion within each subteam for a specific part of project could have
Been done in order to clear any doubts
- We’re losing out on those in class points
- Didn’t have enough time to work on the project

### GLAD:
- Finished our team’s stuff?
- Able to assign tasks for necessary features
- Project is starting to come together visually and functionally
- Project is kinda fun? Different than what you do in other classes
- Feels like we are on top of everything compared to other groups
- great experience working with everyone before we don't know each other.
- Getting real life experience

## Discussion Notes
- We should raise hands more to answer questions and farm those participation points
- Check to make sure we’re on track for the final presentation
- Ensure people have everything in the CI/CD pipeline set up
- Meetings: allow more people to add stuff to the agenda (release meeting notes earlier?)

## TODO in next Sprint:
- Add end to end testing for most (not all) things
- Do stuff in discussion notes
-
