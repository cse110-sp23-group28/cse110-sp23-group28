## Standup

Jackie:
- Working on the gpt-generated stories

Wesley:
- GitHub Actions
- Showing that the card was selected using JS

Cody:
- GitHub Actions
- Will do Version Control
- Ask TA about end to end testing stuff

Steve:
- Working on implementing the canvas feature
- Implemented a working Canvas that allows user to draw anything
- Worked with Brandon and Alvaro to enable the canvas to work on touch-screen devices
- Able to read data from Canvas and return pixel count which will be passed into the algorithm function as a parameter

Jenny:
- Made simulation to visualize the distribution of the fortune telling results using the Zodiac compatibilities, names, and canvas, assuming that every birthday, number, and canvas has an equal chance at getting picked. 
used a uniform distribution for names and canvas (picks random number from 0-1 with all numbers having the same probability) since I don’t have the values for that yet, but I’ll update it once we have the numerology numbers for the names.
- The zodiac compatibilities itself has a bimodal distribution (2 peaks), but with everything together at 0.6/0.3/0.1 weighting, it looks roughly like a normal distribution. 
- Fitted it to a normal distribution so we can use that to roughly control what percent of the time certain time ranges show up

Terry:
- Implement the index pages and make a responsive design.
- Add a word animation and remove the menu.  

Jason:
- Thermometer animates like a progress bar
- Added UI/UX

Brandon:
- Working with steve and alvaro to get canvas stuff done

Ishan:
- Updated the algorithm with the numerology values
