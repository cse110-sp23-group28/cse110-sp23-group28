### Ways of getting input for the fortune:
- Ask user to draw something
- Answer questions (like a quiz)
- Credit card information
- Play some kind of game
- Keyboard smash and analyze the letters
- Putting in your name and count how many vowels/letters/etc in it
- Randomnessï¼Ÿ
- Zodiac
- Tarot card style (choose between several random options)
- Take a quiz first (semi-deterministic), then choose card (random)? Also could do other way around.

### Random or deterministic?
- Combine them, mostly deterministic but add a bit of randomness for variability
