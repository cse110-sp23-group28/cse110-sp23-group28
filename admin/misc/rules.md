# UC Sussy Developers Contract

## What is expected to be on the team:
1. Show up to all scheduled meetings to the best of your ability
2. Communicate when things go wrong
3. Work with others to plan out tasks and finish them by the deadlines
4. Ensure that the entire team is in agreement before making major changes to the project
5. Be open to others' ideas; everyone should generally be working in the best interests of the team

## How to address situations where group "rules" are not being followed:
1. Bring up the conflict to someone in the team
2. We can talk about it and try to resolve the issue ourselves
3. If this does not fix the problem, then we should bring it up to our TA and ask for their advice
4. In the case that the rules are still not being followed after consulting the team and our TA, we should maintain communication and consider revising the rules in an effort to compromise the situation.
