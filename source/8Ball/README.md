# This Is Our 8-Ball Project!

The theme closely matches our team branding.

An 8 ball is something where you ask it a question, and it gives you a yes, no, maybe answers.

Our website works with html, css, and javascript.

There is a input text box in the middle.

The user can put in anything, and there will be text below the textbox to indicate the answer.

# Changes and Improvements
## JS
- Make the button immediately clickable after the message is typed, (instead of waiting for a set 3 secs). More responsive, better UX.
- Use enter key to submit input. Consider users' intuitive inputs, better UX.
- Clear up redundant code for type effect delay. More readable code.
  
## CSS
- Incorporate responsive web design for smaller viewports. Achieved by media query. Better accessibility for different users.
  
## HTML
- Add viewport meta value to prevent zooming in on small-screen devices. Prevent user from misinputs like "double click", better UX.
- Use crewmate picture as default background. Stylistic choice. A more neutral visual for default.
- Add alt attribute to img to pass w3 validation.

## Media
- Convert jpg/png files into webp. Optimize image files into smaller file sizes. Better performance.
- Add site icon. Better site identity.
