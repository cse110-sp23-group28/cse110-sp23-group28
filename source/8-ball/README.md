The theme closely matches our team branding

An 8 ball is something where you ask it a question, and it gives you a yes, no, maybe answers.

Our website works with html, css, and javascript.

There is a input text box in the middle.

The user can put in anything, and there will be text below the textbox to indicate the answer.
